The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## Version 3.2.1 - 2020-11-20

### Fixed

- `cds import` no longer creates `.csn` files with invalid `kind:ComplexType` fields

## Version 3.2.0 - 2020-11-03

### Added

- `cds watch` now allows to set the `--in-memory` flag that is passed to `serve`.

### Changed

- `@sap/cds-dk` is again shrinkwrapped, so that builds get reproducible again
- All `cds` commands now prefer a local installation of `@sap/cds`.  This enables applications better control over the version of `@sap/cds`.
- `cds add cf-manifest` generates the service application with the `random-route: true` flag, which avoids route clashes on CF during development.

### Fixed

- `cds run` finds its `express` module again in the case where no `express` is installed in the application.
- `cds env` now also displays properties that have a value `false` or `''`.
- Leading flags in `cds` CLI work again, like `cds --to sql my.cds`
- `cds compile --to` w/o an argument now fails with a better message

### Removed


## Version 3.1.4 - 2020-10-27

### Fixed

- `cds run` finds the `sqlite3` module again if `cds` is used from a globally installed `@sap/cds-dk`.


## Version 3.1.3 - 2020-10-26

### Fixed

- `cds run` finds the `express` package again in the case where no `express` is installed in the application's `node_modules`.


## Version 3.1.2 - 2020-10-16

### Changed
- `cds init` uses latest `Maven Java archetype` version `1.10.0` for creating Java projects.

### Fixed
- `cds deploy --to sqlite` finds the `sqlite3` module again if `cds` is used from a globally installed `@sap/cds-dk`.


## Version 3.1.1 - 2020-10-07

## Added
- `cds compile --locations` preserves `$location` properties in CSN outputs.

## Changed
- `cds compile` prints a better legible JSON output to terminals
- `cds compile -p` is no longer a shortcut for `--parse`, to allow `--parse ...more-args` to work.
- `cds compile -f` is no longer a shortcut for `--from` (which is not implemented), but for `--flavor`.

### Fixed
- `cds deploy --to sqlite` now writes `requires.db.model` in `package.json` such that `cds.connect.to.('db')` works w/o further `model` options.
- `cds deploy --to sqlite` with `@sap/cds` 4.2 no longer crashes due to a wrong import

## Version 3.1.0 - 2020-09-30

## Added
- `cds compile` now supports option `flavor` with values: `files` | `sources` | `parsed` | `xtended` | `inferred`.
  + `cds compile --files` maps to `--flavor files`.
  + `cds compile --sources` maps to `--flavor sources`.
  + `cds compile --parse` maps to `--flavor parsed`.
  + `cds compile` maps to `--flavor inferred`.
- `cds add cf-manifest` creates manifest.yml and services-manifest.yml allowing for Cloud Foundry native deployment.
- `cds init` now supports type `nodejs` to create a Node.js based project. This is the default and can be omitted.
- `cds watch`: enter `debug` or `debug-brk` to restart process in debug mode.  Other commands are `ps` and `rs`.

### Changed
- `@sap/cds-dk` is no longer shrinkwrapped, so that new versions from underlying `@sap` packages (like `@sap/cds`) are available w/o a new cds-dk version
- `cds init` uses latest `Maven Java archetype` version `1.9.0` for creating Java projects.

### Fixed
- `cds watch` now passes all environment variables to the spawned sub processes, enabling for example, `cds watch --production`
- `cds init` modifies artifact id and Java package name for Java projects to be standard conform.
- `cds` fails with a better error message for misspelled commands


## Version 3.0.0 - 2020-08-31

### Changed
- `cds watch` now uses version 5 of `sqlite3`
- `cds watch` does not use `nodemon` anymore.
  > You can continue using `cds watch` with `nodemon` by installing `nodemon` globally and setting env variable `CDS_USE_NODEMON` to true.
- `cds add mta` for Java applications now determines app details like name, version etc. based on `pom.xml` and no longer from `package.json`.

- `cds import` yields better error messages if the input file does not exists or is invalid
- `cds import` no longer writes a Windows-specific path to `package.json`
- `cds init --add java` shows better error message if Maven is not installed.

## Version 2.0.8 - 2020-08-07

### Changed
- `cds init` uses latest `Maven Java archetype` version `1.8.1` for creating Java projects.

### Fixed

- Fixed `cds add mta` for java projects. The Spring Cloud Profile is set by default for Java apps in order to enable the SAP HANA service binding, otherwise the sqlite db would still be used at runtime.
  The environment variable JBP_CONFIG_RESOURCE_CONFIGURATION required by the classic Java runtime has been removed.

## Version 2.0.7 - 2020-08-04

### Added
- `cds init` supports adding `samples` via `--add samples`. See `cds help init` for more details.
- **Most CLI commands have moved to `@sap/cds-dk`** from `@sap/cds`.  Make sure to install the latest version with `npm i -g @sap/cds-dk`.
- `cds` commands now log a hint to update to the latest `@sap/cds` if this one is still of version 3.
- New command `cds login` added to simplify usage of `cds extend` and `cds activate` by providing them with automatic authentication and saving project settings.
  Refreshes expired authentication tokens automatically. Optionally uses CF command-line client to determine login URLs and subdomains.
  Saves authentication data in plain-text file or desktop keyring on Linux, macOS or Windows.
  The latter requires an optional Node.js module `keytar` to be installed.
- New command `cds logout` removes authentication data and optionally project settings.

### Changed
- `@sap/cdk` no longer warns about `@sap/cds` being globally installed next to it.  This was a temporary hint for the transition period to `@sap/cds-dk`.
- `cds init` generates dependency to `@sap/cds` version `4` for Nodejs projects.
- Use square brackets to pass array values for options to `cds init --java:mvn`.
- `cds init --add pipeline` and `cds add pipeline` now create file `config.yml` in `.pipeline` folder.
- Improved `launch.json` file which is created during `cds init`.
- `cds add mta` now creates a mta.yaml file that sets the production flag for cds build and npm install.
  This ensures that the HANA artefacts are created if `"kind": "sql"` or some `production` profile has been configured in package.json or .cdsrc.json.
  Requires `@sap/cds` version >=4.x.
- `cds init` uses latest `Maven Java archetype` version `1.7.0` for creating Java projects.
- `cds init` no longer adds `package-lock.json` to `.gitignore` file when creating a new project.
- `cds init --add hana` and `cds add hana` now use `Maven Java archetype` to create HANA related pom.xml entries.
- Consistent default naming scheme for applications and services deployed to CF across the following `cds` commands `build`, `deploy`, `init` and `add`. For an application named `myapp` the SAP HANA deployer app name is `myapp-db-deployer`, the SAP HANA DB service name is `myapp-db`.

### Fixed

- Fixed `cds import` to support imports from symlinked sources
- Fixing bug in `cds init` and `cds add` when using multiple features seperated by comma.
- Fixing missing log output bug in `cds init` and `cds add` when using feature `samples`.
- `cds add mta` does no longer crash if no package.json file exists.
